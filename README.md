# scrapy-akordite

I am moving an old (unfinished) spider into a new repository. The idea is to finish it and improve it by enabling pipelines in order to store the scraped data in an SQLite DB. There are roughly 1500 items to be scraped, which contain chords for some popular songs. I might later turn them into a mobile app with React Native.
